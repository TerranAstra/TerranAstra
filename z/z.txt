humanity is fucked

we all see it - the world is on fire from many points of view


each "side" can see the sawdust in the other side.. neither sees their own planks

we hear word 'unity' from sr. leadership of two of the most divided & divisive mouths we've ever known

drumpf is a monster, he is nothing more than TOAFP
most people see his blatant racism.. few of his white supporters

KBRC is also a racist. clearly. unambiguously. right there out in front
my guess is .. similarly few blacks will see it

is this really all any of us have left? "fight, fight, fight" and blamestorm

we need something to look forward to

we  need to stop global inferno

we need someone who ISN"T going to shit all over the other half of the country

i have met loads of people. most fine, +fading. some extreme, +growing. 

feels biblical, honestly

my story - ADHD, revenant, miracle  recip. 

drumpf is nothing but charade

but KBRC makes clear - she serves one* demographic

damn the left - cant reach them
damn the right - hail Mary attempt 

alphabet St. - TN 

lingua franca

some agreed- definitions
prejudice
racism

some MINE:
"them" - elderly, poor, special needs, 





abortion
all say-so / no pesos .. #NoRepresentationWithoutTaxation
